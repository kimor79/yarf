;
; This is a sample config file for yarf.
;
; For `paths' values, the format is like the system's
; PATH environment variable: a list of directories
; separated with a colon in Unix or semicolon in Windows.
; Globs are also allowed; e.g., `/collectd*/'

; The location of the data_types file. Follows
; the php rules for include():
;  http://us.php.net/manual/en/function.include.php
;data_types = '/usr/local/etc/yarf/data_types.php'

; If you want to trim the domain name in the graphs
; set this to the string to trim; e.g.,
;  trim_domain = '.mydomain.com'
; Setting this to a false value or not having it
; in the config will cause yarf to leave the full
; hostname intact.
;trim_domain = ''

[archive]
;paths = "/yarf/archives"

[nodes]
; This determines the behavior (and display) of the
; node selector mechanism.
; By default it is a free form text box where nodes
; are separated by non-alphanumeric, underscore, dot
; and dash characters (/[^\w.-]+/).

; If you have a short list of nodes, enter them
; here comma separated and the text box will be
; displayed as a multi-select box.
;list = ''

; If you have a file containing a list of nodes,
; one per line, with comments (#), set this to the
; full filesystem location to the file;, e.g.,
;  file = "/usr/local/etc/yarf/nodes.txt"
; Setting this will override the list option.
;file = ''

; Set this to a true value if you use nodegroups.
; Setting this will override the list and file options.
;use_nodegroups = false

[quicklinks]
; If you want to have a dropdown with pre-defined
; graph and node selections set these variables.

; Full filesystem location to the quicklinks file;, e.g.,
;  file = "/usr/local/etc/yarf/quicklinks.yaml"
; Format is yaml, e.g.:
;  TCP:
;   All:
;    Day: ?expression......
;file = ''

[rrd]
; If the rrd data is spread across multiple files
; or is somehow delayed, set this option. This will
; instruct rrd_graph to end this many seconds in the past.
; This can be overridden on a per data type basis by
; adding an appropriate --end option in the data types file.
;delay = 0
